## Why are Coatings Important?

Coatings will aid in the preservation of your vehicles clear coat by offering protection from harmful UV rays, bugs, bird droppings, tar and tree sap. Keeping your vehicles exterior in the best possible shape will result in more value when you decide to sell it or trade it in. A coating can last years which is much longer than a wax or sealant. Most waxes may only last a month, a sealant up to 6 months. The coatings we offer last 1-7 years. 


## Why have a coating installed on my car?

Time is money, and having your vehicle coated can eventually for itself over time! One of the great benefits of having a coated car is the ease of maintenance. It will take less time to wash and dry your vehicle due to the hydrophobic (slickness) properties of the of the product, thus saving you money! But wait thereâ€™s more(R.I.P. Billy Mays) you will also no longer have to wax your vehicle, the coating itself acts as a wax in a way but can not be removed without heavy abrasion(compounding, sanding). Unlike wax that can be removed by simply washing with the wrong soap or in a touchless car wash. 

A few other key benefits:

* Nothing sticks to the surface, tree sap wipes right off. Road paint washes right off
* Anti-Graffiti
* Gloss enhancement and color depth
* Vehicle stays cleaner longer
