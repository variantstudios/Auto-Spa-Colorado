## Benefits
Ease of Maintenance. The surface is extremely slick, therefore resulting in nothing sticking to the surface and rolling right off!

Sacrificial layer on top of your clear coat. Most coatings consist of nano particles(very very tiny molecular structures) that will actually go down into your clear coat(see diagram) and then also form a layer on top of your clear coat that cannot be washed away like wax. This is creating a layer of protection on top of your clear coat!

Semi-Permanent to Permanent Bond! The ceramic coatings we offer at Auto Spa cannot be removed by washing your car or even a chemical wash. You would have to literally use abrasives to remove our coatings(high speed polishing/sanding etc.)

Extreme gloss! You thought your paint was perfect and shiny when you purchased it brand new??? Wait until you see what the results of a proper paint correction and coating application will do. We personally have never seen even a clear coat that has been wetsanded and polished be as glossy as a car with orange peel and coated!

Hardness: Clear coats are very sensitive, and sometimes it seems like no matter how careful you are, it is impossible not to leave behind some very light marring or swirls after washing and drying.  Paint coatings are typically harder than your vehicleâ€™s clear coat. This added hardness helps to protect your paint from light marring.  Remember, coatings can still easily be scratched, however they can help to reduce the amount of lighter defects from appearing over time.  This means you will need to polish your vehicle less often.

Resistance to contamination: Fewer contaminates will bond to the surface of the coating, so you will find that you will need to clay your vehicle much less often.  In fact, treating your vehicle with Iron X a couple of times a year may be all that is needed to remove the bonded contaminates from the coating
