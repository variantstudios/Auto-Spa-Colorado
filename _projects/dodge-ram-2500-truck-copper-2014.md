Howdy Partner, this client travels many roads and wanted the best protection possibly for his pick em up truck! With some rock chips and deep scratches this puppy took an intense amount of work. No worries, we melted the clear coat(buffed), touch up the rock chips, applied partial clear bra wrap and armored it with our multi layered ceramic coating.
