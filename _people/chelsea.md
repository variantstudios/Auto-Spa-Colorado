name: Chelsea
bio: >-
  Chelsea is our newest Tint and PPF installer. She works alongside Zack daily,
  installing tint and clear bra on a variety of vehicles. She has a great eye
  for detail and quality installations. She doesn't have a favorite car, its too
  hard to choose in this market. A hobby she enjoys is photography and capturing
  moments in life that could tend to fade away in our memories over time. Her
  favorite thing about working at Greeley Auto Spa is the people!  Everyone
  makes the environment so relaxed and fun, its like a big family, everyone is
  willing to help and she loves working with such down to earth people.
